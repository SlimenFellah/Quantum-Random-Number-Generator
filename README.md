# Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG)

## Overview
The Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG) project leverages quantum mechanics to generate truly random numbers. This project aims to provide a reliable source of randomness for various applications such as cryptography, simulations, and statistical sampling.

## Features
- **True Randomness**: Utilizes quantum phenomena to ensure unpredictability.
- **High Throughput**: Capable of generating random numbers at a high rate.

## Installation
To install the QRNG software, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SlimenFellah/Quantum-Random-Number-Generator.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd qrng
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

<!-- ## Usage -->
<!-- To generate random numbers using the QRNG, run the following command:
```bash
python generate_random_numbers.py --count 100
```
This command will generate 100 random numbers and print them to the console. -->
